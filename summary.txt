Project Name: World Cup Trivia

Project Description: We will use the skills and concepts learnt in CIT 591 to build 
a World Cup soccer trivia skill on Amazon Alexa-enabled devices. 
We will start from a basic Amazon tutorial skill (airplane facts) but extend its 
functionalities to read a cloud-hosted external CSV file and compute the facts to 
generate the trivia, inspired by the Data Science with Airlines assignment.

The end result will be an Alexa Skill that provides on-demand 2018 World Cup trivia.
