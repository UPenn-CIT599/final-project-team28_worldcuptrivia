## World Cup Trivia on Alexa
#### CIT 591, Fall ‘19

### Project idea
We will use the skills and concepts learnt in CIT 591 to build a World Cup soccer trivia skill on Amazon’s Alexa device. We will start from a basic Amazon tutorial skill ([airplane facts](https://github.com/alexa/skill-sample-java-fact)) but extend its functionalities to read an external CSV file and compute the facts to generate the trivia.

### Work breakdown
We will check in weekly to review progress, discuss challenges and next steps & share the work.

We will be inspired by the Agile software development approach, starting with core functions and then taking on more ambitious stretch goals, while adjusting our plan based on user feedback, available resources, pace and obstacles faced.

1. AWS account set up :heavy_check_mark:
