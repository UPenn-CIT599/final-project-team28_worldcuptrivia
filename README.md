## World Cup Trivia on Alexa
#### CIT 591, Fall '19

### Project idea
We will use the skills and concepts learnt in CIT 591 to build a World Cup soccer trivia skill on Amazon Alexa-enabled devices. We will start from a basic Amazon tutorial skill ([airplane facts](https://github.com/alexa/skill-sample-java-fact)) but extend its functionalities to read a cloud-hosted external CSV file and compute the facts to generate the trivia.

### Work breakdown
1. AWS account set up :heavy_check_mark:
- Created AWS Account
- Created Lambda function
- Created Amazon Developer (Alexa)
2. Replicate basic functionalities of airplane facts tutorial :heavy_check_mark:
- Download [airplane facts tutorial repo](https://github.com/alexa/skill-sample-java-fact) locally
- Set up the Lambda function
- Build and deploy the Alexa Skill
- Make a small change to the Skill (get Alexa to give "Harun & Pierre" instead of one of the airplane facts).
