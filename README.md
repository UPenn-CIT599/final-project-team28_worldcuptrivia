## World Cup Trivia on Alexa
#### CIT 591, Fall ‘19

### Project idea
We will use the skills and concepts learnt in CIT 591 to build a World Cup soccer trivia skill on Amazon’s Alexa device. We will start from a basic Amazon tutorial skill ([airplane facts](https://github.com/alexa/skill-sample-java-fact)) but extend its functionalities to include multiple categories. In this way, users will not only be able to ask for general trivia about the World Cup, but also more specific information about particular years of competition, national teams, players, and so on. Once these **core functions** are in place, we would also explore potential **stretch goals**: incorporating voice search, linking to a larger data set, and possibly introducing a game component (e.g. multiple choice questions).

### Work breakdown
We will check in weekly to review progress, discuss challenges and next steps & share the work.

We will be inspired by the Agile software development approach, starting with core functions and then taking on more ambitious stretch goals, while adjusting our plan based on user feedback, available resources, pace and obstacles faced.

1. AWS account set up :heavy_check_mark:
- Created AWS Account
- Created Lambda function
- Created Amazon Developer (Alexa)
2. Replicate basic functionalities of “airplane facts” tutorial (Harun & Pierre) :heavy_check_mark:
- Download [airplane facts tutorial repo](https://github.com/alexa/skill-sample-java-fact) locally
- Set up the Lambda function
- Build and deploy the Alexa Skill
- Make a small change to the Skill (get Alexa to give "Harun & Pierre" instead of one of the airplane facts).
